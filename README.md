# DISC ENCRYPTION SCRIPT

A script that can be used to encrypt or decrypt any file or folder.
In case of dealing with a file, it would directly encrypt the file. Whereas, when we will deal with a directory or a folder, the script will operate over every content of the folder individually. It will deal with the sub-folders in the same way, i.e., operating over its content individually. You can enter a folder or subfolder but you won't be able to read the file contents.

## Note
The script can be used as a ransomeware after few tweeks(you know what I am saying). The developers of the script or the modules won't be responsible if the script is used in the wrong way without the system owner's permission.

## INSTALLATION
We need to install python. Install it with the help of online tutorials available for free.
Then enter:

`pip install pyAesCrypt`

You are redy to go.

Type: `python3 <global location of the script>`

Enter the asked informations and you are ready to see the magic of the script
